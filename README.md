- üìä Searches eBay's completed/sold listings for accurate price comparisons

## Installation

2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar

### Permanent Installation
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sgwpricecheck/

## Usage

### On Search Results/Listing Pages:
1. Visit [shopgoodwill.com](https://shopgoodwill.com)
2. Right-click on any item title/link
3. Select "üîç Compare on eBay" from the context menu

### On Individual Item Pages:
1. Open any item page on shopgoodwill.com
2. Right-click anywhere on the page
3. Select "üîç Compare This Item on eBay"

In both cases, a new tab will open showing eBay's completed/sold listings for that item.

## How It Works

The extension:
1. Monitors for right-clicks on shopgoodwill.com
2. Captures the item title from either:
   - The clicked link text
   - The item page's title
3. Cleans up the title by removing:
   - Marketing terms (TESTED, LAST CHANCE, NWT, etc.)
   - Quality indicators (Near Mint, VG+, etc.)
   - Percentage discounts
   - Special characters
   - Parenthetical text
   - Store-specific references
4. Creates an eBay search URL using the cleaned title
5. Opens the search in a new tab
